1. License Overview

This repository contains public documentation, architectural descriptions, and high-level conceptual frameworks related to:

BoonMindX

ZeroCode OS

VR-9

BUE Framework

Observer-Coupled Computational Reality (OCCR)

All core mathematical operators, update rules, transforms, compilers, kernels, and internal state mappings are explicitly proprietary and are not included in this repository.

This license governs:

✔ Public documentation
✔ Public diagrams and explanations
✔ Public research notes
✔ High-level conceptual architecture
✔ Public-access text, images, and non-functional examples

This license does not grant access to any working implementation or proprietary system components.

2. Grant of Permission (Public Materials Only)

You are permitted to:

View, read, and share the public documentation in this repository

Use the public materials for academic discussion, research review, and technical analysis

Cite this work in papers, articles, or public communication

Fork the repository for documentation purposes

This permission is granted royalty-free, worldwide, and non-exclusive, subject to the restrictions in Sections 3–7.

3. Restrictions

You may NOT:

3.1 Reverse-Engineer or Reconstruct

Attempt to derive, infer, approximate, reconstruct, or reverse-engineer:

Recursion update equations

Observer coupling transforms

THRUM algorithms

ZeroCode AST compiler

VR-9 geospatial operators

Internal kernels, transforms, or weighting functions

Any component not explicitly published in this repository

This includes attempts via:

simulation

emulation

model-fitting

behavioral cloning

system probing

statistical approximation

dynamical inference

The architecture is explicitly non-injective and path-dependent, and any reconstruction attempts are prohibited.

3.2 Create Derivative Implementations

You may NOT build:

competing systems

derivative frameworks

parallel recursion engines

observer-coupled computational systems

visualizers based on THRUM-like transforms

…based on the concepts, descriptions, diagrams, or public explanations provided here.

Derivative systems require a commercial or research license.

3.3 Commercial Use Prohibited

The public documentation may not be used for any commercial purpose without written permission from the BoonMind Project.

Commercial use includes but is not limited to:

product development

paid consulting

commercial research

VC-backed prototypes

AI/ML tooling

VR/XR implementations

internal enterprise deployment

4. Proprietary Components (Not Licensed)

The following components are strictly proprietary and not included in this license:

Recursion update equations (BUE, RHC, dual-strand operators)

THRUM field operators and negative recursion operators

ZeroCode compiler, AST transforms, or runtime engine

VR-9 geometric kernels and spatial recursion transforms

Biometric weighting functions, observer encoding, O(t) transforms

Pattern memory compression or tension-decay mechanisms

Stability guards, anti-divergence logic, or resumable state operators

Use or reproduction of these components is strictly prohibited without NDA access.

5. No Warranty

This documentation is provided:

“AS IS,” without warranty of any kind, express or implied.

The BoonMind Project disclaims all liability for:

accuracy

completeness

experimental reproducibility

errors

omissions

damages arising from interpretation or misuse

6. NDA Access for Core Operators

Access to the BoonMindX / ZeroCode / VR-9 internal systems is available only via:

executed NDA

research partnership

commercial license

written authorization

Contact: codedawakening@proton.me

7. Termination

This license terminates automatically if you:

violate any restriction in Sections 3 or 4

attempt to reconstruct proprietary components

use public documentation to develop competitive systems

engage in commercial use without agreement

Upon termination, all rights granted by this license are revoked immediately.

8. Governing Law

This license is governed by the laws of:

England & Wales (internationally standard, used by OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind-aligned orgs)

9. Attribution Requirement

If you redistribute any public portion of this documentation, you must include:

Used under the BoonMindX Hybrid License v1.0  
Public documentation only. Proprietary components excluded.  

10. Summary (Human-Readable)

You can read, share, and cite the docs.

You cannot rebuild the system.

You cannot approximate or reconstruct the protected operators.

You cannot use this for commercial purposes.

You cannot build derivative recursion or observer-coupled systems.

The real engine remains proprietary, non-injective, and NDA-only.

Violations terminate rights immediately.
